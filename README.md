# Java_Assignment-5

This repository contains a simple Java program for calculating the area and perimeter of different shapes such as Circle, Triangle, and Rectangle.

Contents Introduction Usage Shapes Introduction This Java program provides implementations for the following shapes:

Circle Triangle Rectangle For each shape, the program calculates both the area and perimeter based on the given dimensions.

Usage To use this program, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE. Run the Assignment_5_main.java file. The program will display the area and perimeter for each shape. Shapes Circle The Circle class represents a circle shape. It takes the radius as input to calculate the area and perimeter.

Triangle The Triangle class represents a triangle shape. It takes the lengths of the base and height as input to calculate the area and perimeter.

Rectangle The Rectangle class represents a rectangle shape. It takes the lengths of the length and breadth as input to calculate the area and perimeter.
